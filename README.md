# V-SPOMs
## What is V-SPOMs?
### Definition
V-SPOMs is short for `Visualize - Spatial Patch Occupancy Models`.

### What is SPOMs?
A statistical models used in ecology to analyze species distribution patterns in fragmented landscapes.

### What SPOMs can do?
1. Predict the effects of habitat fragmentation on species populations and identify areas critical for conservation.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of management strategies aimed at maintaining or restoring habitat connectivity.

### Why SPOMs is important?
It is crucial for understanding the relationships between species, habitats, and landscapes in the face of environmental change.

## Why V-SPOMs? 
### SPOMs is simple, but **hard** to understand!
* The core idea of SPOMs is simple. However, it is difficult to understand when only using text and math equations.
* Our customer works as a professor at the University of Glasgow. 
* Thus, he wants a software program that can visualize SPOMs to make understanding easier for the students he taught.
### Problems with SPOMsim
* SPOMsim is also a program that visualize SPOMs.
* However, there are three main issue with the program.
    1. It supports only Windows, which is not great for students who use MacOS or Linux.
    2. The program is currently unable to download.
    3. The current program has an old UI/UX design.
* In conclusion, our customer wants a new visualize SPOMs software that does not have these three issues present in SPOMsim.
